				One very common practice with HTML, is to use HTML tables to format the layout of an HTML page. 
A part of this page is formatted with two columns, like a newspaper page.

As you can see at this page, there is a left column and a right column.

			</td>
			<td id="xxx">
				An HTML <table> is used to divide a part of this Web page into two columns. 
This text is displayed in the right column.

The trick is to use a table without borders, and maybe a little extra cell-padding.

No matter how much text you add to this page, it will stay inside its column borders.

			</td>
		</tr>

	</table>
